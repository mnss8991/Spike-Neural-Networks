Quantitative Measures for Understanding Spiking Neural Networks\
1.Analyzed and understood that noise is the limitation of basic biological neural model.\
2.Studied and simulated the quantitative metrics necessary for implanting the noise for the models using sPyNNaker framework of UK Manchester University.\
3.Metrics used : population Averaging, Temporal Averaging and Average on Trails and observed that population averaging gives better results\
4.Presented a poster as part of our Research Practice
